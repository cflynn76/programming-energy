In this case, it creates a sequence from 1 to 10. More information on using the range function can be found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_range.asp). Each time a loop is executed, the value of i is incremented by 1. When i equals 10 Python exits the for loop and continues on with any code after the for loop.\n",
