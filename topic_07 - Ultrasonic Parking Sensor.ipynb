    "## Exercise 1 – Measure Distance with an ultrasonic distance sensor\n",
    "The HC-SR04 sensor sends out pulses of ultrasoundand detects the echo that bounces back. It then works out the distance to the object the signal bounced back off. There are 4 pins on the sensor - VCC, trigger, echo, and ground. The trigger and echo pins are connected to two gpio pins on the Raspberry Pi. Two resistors (330 $\\ohm$ and 470 $\\ohm$) are also used to set up a potential divider. A voltage divider is required to ensure the 5V from the ECHO pin doesn’t damage the Pi. Wire your sensor according to the following instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Connect the GND pin of the sensor to a ground pin on the Pi.\n",
    "- Connect the TRIG pin of the sensor a GPIO pin.\n",
    "- Connect one end of a 330Ω resistor to the ECHO pin of the sensor.\n",
    "- Connect one end of a 470Ω resistor to the GND pin of the sensor.\n",
    "- Connect the free ends of both resistors to another GPIO pin. This forms the required voltage divider.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, connect the VCC pin of the sensor to a 5V pin on the Pi.\n",
