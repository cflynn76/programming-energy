    "A servo motor is a motor than can rotate to a specified angle. This is unlike a DC motor, which can only be turned on or off or run at different speeds. You can control the position and speed of a DC motor through the use of a motor controller. You do not need this for a servo motor. Most servo motors have a range of 0-180 degrees.\n",

    "Connect the 5V pin to the power cable of the servo (this is typically colored red). Connect the ground cable of the servo (typically colored black or brown) to the GND pin. Connect the final cable (typically colored white or orange) to the GPIO pin you wish to use for controlling the servo.\n",

Documentation on the Servo function can be found [here](https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_output.html#servo). Copy the following code into the shell and run it. The servo should move to its mid-point by default and then move to its minimum value. Measure the angle from the mid-point.  "
